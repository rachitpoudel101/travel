# Travelo - Online Tour Guide System

### We are 3rd-year undergraduates of SLIIT and this project was built for the module Software Project Management (SE3080).
A brief description of the project is stated below,

### Travelo is a travel assistance website that was built to help travelers to make their journey more enjoyable, safe, and easy.
Travelers can hire a travel guide, book hotels, or purchase a whole travel package which includes hotels to stay, transport facilities, and tour guides.
Also, travelers can create their own travel packages as they prefer.
